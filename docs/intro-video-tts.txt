Hey there, and welcome! Thank you so much for checking out Notebook Navigator.

[short pause]

In this video, I'll walk you through everything you need to get started... from installation to mastering the two-pane interface.

[pause]

Here's the vault we'll be working with today. It's called Demo, and it has two folders: AI and Photo. I've also set up some tags like ai slash openai, ai slash anthropic, and ai slash google.

[short pause]

Let's get started.

First, let's install Notebook Navigator.

[short pause]

Open Obsidian settings by clicking the gear icon in the bottom left corner.

[short pause]

Go to Community plugins in the sidebar. If this is your first community plugin, you'll need to click Turn on community plugins and confirm.

[pause]

Now click Browse, and search for Notebook Navigator.

[short pause]

There it is! Click Install, then click Enable.

[short pause]

You'll see a new icon appear in your ribbon on the left side. Click it to open Notebook Navigator.

[pause]

And we're in!

This is Notebook Navigator.

[short pause]

The interface is split into two panes.

[pause]

On the left is the NAVIGATION pane. This is where you'll find your folders, tags, shortcuts, and recent notes.

[short pause]

On the right is the LIST pane. When you select a folder or tag on the left, its notes appear here on the right.

[pause]

Let me click the AI folder. See how the list updates? Now let me click Photo. Different files.

[short pause]

Tags work the same way. I'll click ai slash anthropic, and now I see all notes with that tag.

[pause]

At the top of the list pane, you'll find controls for search, sorting, appearance, and this important toggle... Show notes from subfolders and descendants.

Let's talk about this descendants toggle... it's REALLY important.

[pause]

When it's ON, selecting a folder shows notes from that folder AND all its subfolders. Same with tags... you'll see notes from the selected tag and all child tags.

[short pause]

When it's OFF, you only see notes that are DIRECTLY in that folder or have EXACTLY that tag.

[pause]

If you ever think "why am I seeing so many files?"... check this toggle first.

[short pause]

It's enabled by default, and your preference is saved per device.

The navigation pane has four main sections.

[short pause]

At the top, you have SHORTCUTS. This is your quick access area... pin your most-used notes, folders, tags, or even saved searches here.

[short pause]

Below that is RECENT NOTES, which automatically tracks what you've opened recently.

[short pause]

Then you have your FOLDERS tree, and finally your TAGS tree.

[pause]

To add something to shortcuts, just right-click and select Add to shortcuts. You can also drag items up to the shortcuts section.

[short pause]

Pro tip: There are commands to open shortcuts one through nine directly, so you can bind them to keyboard shortcuts like Command-1 for instant access!

Don't like the default order? You can customize it.

[short pause]

Click Reorder navigation in the toolbar.

[pause]

Now you can drag sections to rearrange them. Want tags above folders? Just drag.

[short pause]

You can also reorder your ROOT folders and ROOT tags to put your most-used items at the top.

[short pause]

If you want to reset, there are options for alphabetical order or frequency-based order.

[short pause]

Click Done reordering when you're finished.

The list pane has two display modes: Standard and Compact.

[short pause]

In STANDARD mode, each note shows its title, modification date, a preview of the content, and... if available... a feature image thumbnail.

[pause]

[excited] One of my favorite features... Notebook Navigator automatically generates thumbnails from the first image in your notes. It even works with external images, YouTube thumbnails, PDFs, and Excalidraw drawings!

[pause]

In COMPACT mode, you just see the title... great for maximum density.

[short pause]

Click Appearance to customize. You can adjust how many lines of title and preview text to show, and enable grouping by date... Today, Yesterday, Previous 7 days, and so on.

[short pause]

The best part? These settings can be customized PER FOLDER and PER TAG.

Sorting works on two levels.

[short pause]

You have a DEFAULT sort order that applies everywhere, and you can set CUSTOM overrides for specific folders or tags.

[short pause]

Click Sort to see your options: modified date, created date, or alphabetical... ascending or descending.

[pause]

If you set a custom sort for a folder, it's remembered. Navigate away and come back... your preference is still there.

[short pause]

To clear a custom sort, just select Default.

Search lets you filter the current folder or tag.

[short pause]

Just type to search by filename. Add a HASHTAG to filter by tag.

[short pause]

You can combine them. For example, "meeting hashtag work" finds notes with "meeting" in the name AND the work tag.

[short pause]

Use an EXCLAMATION MARK to exclude. "Exclamation hashtag draft" hides all drafts.

[pause]

Here's a power tip: In the list pane, you can Command-click or Control-click on a tag chip to add it to your search filter. Hold Shift for an OR search.

[short pause]

Found a search you use often? Save it as a shortcut! Click the save icon next to the search field, give it a name, and it'll appear in your shortcuts section for one-click access.

Tags in Notebook Navigator are fully interactive.

[short pause]

To ADD a tag to notes, just drag them onto a tag in the navigation pane. Works with multiple notes too!

[short pause]

To REMOVE all tags from notes, drag them onto Untagged.

[pause]

You can also reorganize your tag hierarchy with drag and drop.

[short pause]

Drag a tag onto another tag to RENAME or NEST it. This opens a rename dialog where you can confirm the change.

[short pause]

Want to promote a nested tag to the root level? Drag it onto the Tags header.

[short pause]

All tag changes update your actual note files... nothing is stored separately.

Pinning keeps important notes at the top of your list.

[short pause]

Right-click a note and select Pin note. It moves to a pinned section at the top.

[pause]

Here's something useful to know: folder pins and tag pins are SEPARATE. A note can be pinned in your folder view but not in your tag view, or vice versa, or both.

[short pause]

This gives you flexibility to organize differently depending on how you're browsing.

Make your vault visually distinctive with custom icons and colors.

[short pause]

Right-click any folder to access Change icon, Change color, and Change background.

[short pause]

The icon picker includes thousands of icons from popular icon packs like Font Awesome, Material Icons, and Bootstrap.

[pause]

Want to apply the same style to multiple items? Use the Style menu. Copy a style from one folder, then paste it onto others.

[short pause]

You can also customize individual files... right-click any note to change its icon or color.

[short pause]

For power users, there are settings to automatically assign icons based on filename patterns or file types.

There's a LOT you can customize in settings.

[short pause]

Open Obsidian settings and find Notebook Navigator.

[short pause]

The General tab covers layout options, dual pane orientation, and filtering.

[short pause]

Navigation pane and List pane tabs let you fine-tune each side of the interface.

[short pause]

The Notes tab controls how individual notes appear... preview text, dates, tags, and feature images.

[short pause]

And Icon packs is where you enable additional icon libraries.

[short pause]

I won't go through every option... just explore and hover over settings to see what they do!

That's Notebook Navigator!

[short pause]

A two-pane interface that makes navigating large vaults intuitive and fast.

Thanks for watching, and happy note-taking!
